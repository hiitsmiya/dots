i now have a autorice script where you could get all my programs and configs, 
***ONLY USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. i'd suggest only using it if you understand the source and what it is doing***
if you accept the risk, when you enter a fresh install of arch do:
```cd /Documents/ && git clone https://github.com/notdeven/dots && chmod +x /Documents/dots/autorice.sh && ~/Documents/dots/autorice.sh```
