# dots


just my configs and scripts for i3-gaps.

i have a autorice script where you could get all my programs and configs, ***ONLY USE AT YOUR OWN RISK, THIS IS POORLY WRITTEN, as i don't have a lot of skill lol. i'd suggest only using it if you know what you're doing.***

if you accept the risk, when you enter a fresh install of arch do:

```cd /Documents/ && git clone https://github.com/notdeven/dots && chmod +x /Documents/dots/autorice.sh && ~/Documents/dots/autorice.sh```
