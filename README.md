# dots


just my configs and scripts for i3-gaps.

there is a autorice script where you could get all my programs and ditfiles, ONLY USE AT YOUR OWN RISK, THIS IS POORLY WRITTEN. i made it for me but when you enter a fresh install of arch do:

```cd /Documents/ && git clone https://github.com/notdeven/dots && chmod +x /Documents/dots/autorice.sh && ~/Documents/dots/autorice.sh```

pipes.
